# 📚 DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice repository!  
This repository contains my personal solutions to various DSA problems that I’ve solved as part of my learning and preparation for technical interviews.

## 🛠 Languages Used

- **C** ⚙️  
- **C++** 💻  
- **Python** 🐍

Solutions may vary across languages based on the problem requirements or my exploration of different approaches.
